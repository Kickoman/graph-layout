# Graph Layout library

This library was created for testing different graph layout algorithmes,
basically the force-based ones. For example, here implemented the
"Springs and Electrons" algorithm (*i can't remember how it is called for real
now*). Yep, that algorithm where you imagine that the edges of the graph are
the springs and the nodes of the graph are the electrons. So, the connected
nodes are attracting to each other, and the other ones are repulse from each other.

Look at `src/graphcalculator.cpp` for more. (Links are coming soon)

### Requirements & dependencies

Currently this library depends on Qt Framework (strictly speaking, on some
libraries from Qt), but I'm going to get rid of that dependency soon. See
**issues** for more information.
